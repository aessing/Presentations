Data, Cloud, [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) & [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) Enthusiast, Community Addict and Cloud Solution Architect @ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)

In my spare time I am speaking at user groups and at international conferences, teaching about cloud data services and how to use them in the best possible manner. Also, I am working on different small community and open-source projects.

This repository hosts slides and demos from presentations I did at conferences, user groups, meetups, and webcasts.

_The content of this repository is intended only as a supplement to my presentations, demos, and lectures._
